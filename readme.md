# Flow.sh

An toolkit for developers to manage our flow state. 

## Features
- Integration with Todoist to mange your tasks
- stream music that helps you get into flow
- Metrics to track your flow states.
- Open-Source! Feel free to fork and make your own changes

## Why?
You will probably have experienced flow stage sometime in your
life. It is a state of mind that we call as "being in the zone". 
For deves like us it is that time when we are working on a problem with such 
focus that everything else is blocked and at the end of these sessions you are in
a blissefull state that I like to call "programmers high". 

I was really interested in knowing more about this state and how
I can personally manage my flow state that is why I made this set of 
tools. I wanted something that I can mold to my usage (kinda like vim) that
would help me get better insights into how I work and carry out my tasks. I hope you find 
these set of tools useful too. If you have any issues/comments/suggestions feel free to raise it
in the issues page.

### Where is the code?
I'm trying out [Readme Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) 
and hence wrote this README first.
